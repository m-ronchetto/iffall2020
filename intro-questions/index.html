            <h2>
                1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).
            </h2>
            My name is Madison. I am a junior majoring in Communication Design (with minors in CS and Psych).
            <h2>
                2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.
            </h2>
            I am interested in working as a UX Designer, so I want to improve my Web Dev skills for rapid prototyping.
            <h2>
                3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.
            </h2>
            I have self-studied limited amounts of html/css, and I have used it to start working on my portfolio from scratch.
            You can view that progress 
             <a href="https://github.com/m-ronchetto/Portfolio">here</a>.
            <h2>
                4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.
            </h2>
            I want to get a bit more confident with CSS and creating multi-page sites.
            <h2>
                5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
            </h2>
            When designing for a screen, you have to ensure your designs are scalable in many formats (web, mobile, tablet, etc).
            <h2>
                6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.
            </h2>
            I think Starbuck's website 
            <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">here</a> has a very recognizable design through the jewel tone palette and consistent treatment of type, banners, and buttons.
            <h2>
                7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.
            </h2>
            Pew Research's articles have data visualizations that are simple and legible, especially in these graphs
             <a href= "https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/"> here
             </a>.
            <h2>
                8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.
            </h2>
            <a href= "https://www.airbnb.com/"> Airbnb's</a> web app is simple to navigate on mobile and web, and I think it works well because it highlights the most relevant filters 
            and updates the other parameters as demands for housing changes.
