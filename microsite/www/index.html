                The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Kodak /ˈkoʊdæk/) is an American public company that 
                produces various products related to its historic basis in analogue photography. The company is headquartered 
                in Rochester, New York, and is incorporated in New Jersey. Kodak provides packaging, functional printing,
                graphic communications, and professional services for businesses around the world. Its main business segments 
                are Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, Software and Solutions, and Consumer 
                and Film. It is best known for photographic film products.

                Kodak was founded by George Eastman and Henry A. Strong on September 4, 1888. During most of the 20th century, Kodak 
                held a dominant position in photographic film. The company's ubiquity was such that its "Kodak moment" tagline entered 
                the common lexicon to describe a personal event that deserved to be recorded for posterity. Kodak began to struggle
                financially in the late 1990s, as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its slowness in moving 
                to digital photography, despite developing the first self-contained digital camera. As a part of a turnaround 
                strategy, Kodak began to focus on digital photography and digital printing, and attempted to generate revenues 
                through aggressive patent litigation.
